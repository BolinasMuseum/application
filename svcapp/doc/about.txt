Chain
=====

THIS DOCUMENT IS OUT OF DATE FOR HELLO MOON

Purpose
-------

SVCAPP is designed to integrate all three layers.

Quality
-------

The code has not been used wideliy in production.
It does have pretty good unit test coverage.
It is not very well documented, and has no coherent javadocs.
  It was much better documented before dan got his hands on it, for which he will spend more time in pergatory.
Error handling is okay, but not perfect.

Some tests will fail on boxes without /tmp (Windows) because some missing features mean that it must be hardwired.

Configuration
-------------

You can configure where the schemas and objects are stored. Each is a string which is a path to the store for schemas
or the store for objects.

	private static final String STORE_PROPERTY="cspace.chain.store.dir";
	private static final String SCHEMA_PROPERTY="cspace.chain.schema.dir";

These can be supplied as system properties or, preferably, in a file called chain.properties somewhere on the classpath.
If both are missing, the current tmpdir is used.
