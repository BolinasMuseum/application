This package implements JPath. It is used in JXJ to specify a path through some JSON to some data. The names are stupid
and should probably be changed.

JPathPath -- Corresponds to a single path
JPathPathParser -- [package scope] Parses a path. Used internally
InvalidJpathException -- Raised at compile or run time when a JPath is invalid for some reason
