This package implements a system of finding configuration parameters from disparate sources. Its main tasks are to
partition into different classes these different methods and to introduce an XML control file format to describe them,
to allow us to easily change the order and the names of any required keys/paths.

Note that this class is just for the bootstrap configuration, so the actual control file will probably end up being
rather small, listing only very few options (perhaps only two or three in the end), but a large number of places to 
look for them, which is why the XML file allows you to specify them is the way around that it is.

ConfigLoadMethod -- the interface implemented by methods
StringReadingConfigLoadMethod -- abstract base type for many methods, probably a bit useless now
ConfigLoadController -- the main controller
ConfigLoadFailedException -- an error occurred during loading
ConfigOptionSource -- [package scope] internal use, a part of the control file

Methods:
DefaultConfigLoadMethod -- use string provided (a fallback)
TmpdirConfigLoadMethod -- use tmpdir (a fallback)
AttributeConfigLoadMethod -- use servlet attribute (useful during testing)
PropertyConfigLoadMethod -- load from properties file
