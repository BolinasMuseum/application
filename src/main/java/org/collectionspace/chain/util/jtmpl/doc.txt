Used in JXJ.

Goofy template language for JSON. There don't seem to be any good ones out there. We wanted to make the language
valid JSON itself, hence the weird syntax. A string beginning \u0000 followed by a key symbolises a slot in the
template. This syntax was chosen as \u0000 is an invalid unicode character so shouldn't occur in real life, but is
valid JSON. Of course that doesn't hold water if you want to use this JSON template in a template itself, or similar
circumstances. As I say, goofy. Patches welcome.

JTmplTmpl -- the template itself.
JTmplDocument -- an instance thereof ready for the filling out with values.
InvalidJTmplException -- Something went wrong.
