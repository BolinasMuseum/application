To return the UI Spec (once called a schema).

This package is essentially entirely a stub. At the moment we get stuff just off the file-system in JSON. It will
be derived from the config instead. Though there is an API and Impl in here, that doesn't signify much as this whole
package will change imeasurably shortly.

SchemaStore -- retrieve a schema (API)
StubSchemaStore -- retrieve a schema (Impl)
