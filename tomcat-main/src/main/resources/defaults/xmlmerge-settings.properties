#
# This file configures merging rules for tenant-related settings, when merging the contents
# of one or more (optional) 'patch' files with those of a tenant's settings.xml file.
#

#
# This is an XMLMerge properties file. It is used to configure the rules via
# which XmlMerge will merge two XML files, an original file and a 'patch' file,
# to create a third, merged file, whether in memory, on disk, or in both places.
#
# These rules specify:
#   * A matcher ("matcher"): Specifies whether matches between XML elements in the original file
#     and the patch file are to be found by TAG (element name), ID ("id=" attribute), or otherwise.
#   * An XPath value or values ("xpath"): Identifies selected elements, if any, to be found within
#     the original file, on which merge actions other than the default action are to be performed.
#   * An action ("action"): Specifies how values in the patch file are to be merged with those in
#     the original file. (If no action is specified, the 'default' action will be used.)
